A brief look into road casualties in Scotland over the past couple of years; with driving as an integral part of most people’s everyday life, do you really know how safe you are?
Fortunately for you, there has been a decline in the annual number of road casualties over the last 25 years:

From the graph above, which plots the total number of people killed or seriously injured in a car accident each year, from 1996 to 2021. This shows a clear decrease in car accident related deaths and injuries over this time period. This could indicate either an increased caution among drivers and more awareness of road safety laws, or improved emergency services reaction on scene.
The next question to answer is: Who is getting into car accidents? The following graph shows the proportion of male to female victims involved in car accidents every year:

Where the ratio male to female car accident victims is greater than one, the number of male victims was greater than female victims. We can therefore see from this graph that over the past 25 years, males have always been more likely to be killed or injured in a car accident than females. This is a very messy and variable graph, so it would be better to add a line of best fit, in order to be able to see a slight trend, if any:

The constant increase of the male-female ratio shows that each year, men are even more likely to be victims of car accidents than women.
Finally, a look at where in Scotland exactly are people victims of serious car accidents. The following is a graph based on the number of car casualties by location in 2005:

This map of Scotland, split by council areas, is shaded based on the total number of people killed or seriously injured in a car accident in the year 2005. The darker the shade of red here, the more car casualties occurred. This graph does not immediately appear to tell us anything, so we can additionally look at the number of car casualty victims weighted by population:

The above graph shows the number of people killed or seriously injured per 10,000 people in each Scottish council area, for the year 2005. Here, we can see a clearer distinction, and perhaps also gauge a relationship between the population density of an area and the number of serious car accidents. The graph, with a darker blue indicating more car casualties per 10,000 people, seems to show that a less densely populated area has higher numbers of serious car accidents, as a proportion of the population.
