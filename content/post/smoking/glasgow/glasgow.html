<h4>From 2012 to 2019 the Scottish Survey Core Question(SSCQ), which is a project drawing together multiple household survey(for more in about the SSCQ click <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-surveys-core-questions/">here</a> </a>), was used as a indicator for people smoking in Scotland.</h4>


<p>And what you will find when looking at the data that people decide to quit the cigarrete. The causation can not be told from the data but we can discover the sometimes extreme difference and drop of for each age group of the population and each consticuency in Scotland</p>

<h4>Different population group smoking percentage</h4>

<p>The following maps show the difference for Total and different age groups percentage of smoking of each year</p>

<img src="/images/blog/2022/smoking/yearOver64.gif" style="height: 70%; width: 70%"></img>
<p>We can sea that there was an over all decrease which can be further support with this graph</p>

<p>This also clearly show the significant difference that if you want to make it to your 70s and over to quit the cigarrete also that our precious elderly don't follow the trend of the other age groups in dropping the cigarrete with consistenly about 15% of them smoking every year</p>

<p>We can also see the difference of other groups like pensioners, people who have children and the male and female population</p>

<p>With the most interesting think coming out from this being that the male population smokes more than the average and that people with children also generally smoke more than the average james</p>

<h4>Comparing male and female</h4>

<p>The last map - total percentage of fires/total percentage of population for each constituency - is not a good indicator for prediction of fires because their is little correlation when plotting fires per population(look at graphs below)</p>
<p>graphs where plotted using the pearson correlation</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/NotAcciCorrelation.png" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<p>30% accurate to predict number of Not-Accidental fires per population</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/AcciCorrelation.png" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<p>47% Accurate to predict number of Accidental fires per population</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/AllCorrelation.png" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<p>43% accurate to predict number of All fires in scotland per population
Note: each point represents a consticuency with the most recent population estimates and number of fires for each category from 2020/2021
It is difficult to predict how many fires are happening but we can find the average amount of fires each year and day for the nation/council region using data from the last five years</p>

<p>The government puts fires in two major categories
Accidental and Not Accidental
We can see how they make up the percentage of total fires over the last three years</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/donut20-21.jpeg" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/donut19-20.jpeg" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<img src="/images/blog/2022/fire/donut18-19.jpeg" style="height: 100%; width:100%"></img>
<p>This shows that clearly there is stable trend from expecting how many fires of the total fires are Accidental (around 42.7%) and Not Accidental fires (around 57.3%)</p>
<p>Thank you for reading the first post, this took me longer then I like to admit but I am grateful and hope that you found it at least interesting. If you want to use any of the graphs please go to the contact page and fill in the form.</p>
