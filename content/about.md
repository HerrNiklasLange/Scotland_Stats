## Who are we?
We are a small group of Students from Hutcheson's Grammar School in Glasgow who are eager to help people see through the data and practice our skills while at the same time publishing it for all of you to see.

We are young and still have a lot to learn but we hope that through out the posts you can see a clear improvement
